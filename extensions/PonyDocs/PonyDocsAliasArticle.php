 * Ok, so when using a URL alias we have to hook into ArticleFromTitle so that it can take the input TITLE and translate it to the REAL
 * article title.  From that it creates an Article object to pass back.  However this would NOT work -- it would act like there was no
 * content for every article resulting.
 * 
 * Oddly what did work is subclassing it and removing the fluff from 'getContent()' -- meaning everything.  It just returns the stored
 * content from the attribute 'mContent'.  This for some strange reason works perfectly -- onArticleFromTitle returns an instance of this
 * instead and voila.
